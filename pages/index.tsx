            I am a final year computing student at the National University of
            Singapore. As a tech enthusiast, I find myself spending a chunk of
            my time learning and developing arbitrary apps with new tech stacks.
            Weird how building things out of nothing brings me joy. I am also a
            believer of ethical and collaborative programming, and am constantly
            looking for opportunities to make a change the digital way. When I
            am not programming, you might find me contributing to{' '}
